        Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe.
        Sure, we are too old to change the world, but what about that kid,
        sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local
        library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the
        Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Does not HE deserve better? Look. If
        you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you should
        better think again. This is about that right to read a book without
        getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe
        that is how you get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies.
